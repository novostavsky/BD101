Some bids have the same price/money for 2+ countries,
so in calculation I implemented the first max price I get is what I store.
And the provided test use US country for all such cases.

I beleive that "test datasets" sould not contain duplicates,
or the task should be changed to add deterministic approach (priority of losa pre countries)
        e.g.   US>CA>MX, so if you have to choose between US and CA, you choose US always
